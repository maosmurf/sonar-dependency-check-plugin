  - You are not bundling GLUE Standard or a derivative of it
    as part of a software development environment such as

    everyday development.

    into a software infrastructure platform such as WebLogic, 
    Apache SOAP, WebSphere, Oracle application server,

    software infrastructure vendors, and does not prevent developers
    from using and bundling GLUE Standard with applications that run
    on these platforms.

  - You are not deploying GLUE Standard or a derivative of it
    on a device which is not a standard PC or server. Examples
